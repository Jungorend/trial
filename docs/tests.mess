# Tests
Trial offers some amount of automated testing to verify its behaviour.

## Selftest
The selftest suite exists primarily to verify whether the platform performs as Trial expects it to. This is useful when porting to new architectures or operating systems.

The selftest suite will go through a variety of features and print a summary of failed tests at the end. While performing tests, it will spawn external processes and show a bunch of windows to test various features. The tests will automatically close all windows, so you can simply let it run its course.
